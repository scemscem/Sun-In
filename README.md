Inside this github project you will find 3 codes.

The first is for a 2 minute simulation of the whole year.

So by applying it to Sun-In you will quickly see how the 4 seasons work.

The second is a 4-minute code with a random season, winter, so you can appreciate and study the intensity and propagation of light in detail.

The third is the real code, the one which, applied to Sun-In, is based on the city of Turin (Italy) to last an entire year
